## 📥 Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jwerr/CleverHire.git
```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**

```bash
cd CleverHire
```

3. **Create a virtual environment**

```bash
python -m venv venv
```

4. **Activate the virtual environment**

* For Windows:

```bash
venv\Scripts\activate
```

* For Linux/Mac:

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

5. **Install dependencies**

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

6. **Set up environment variables (if preferred)**
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the following:

```
COHERE_API_KEY=your-cohere-api-key
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key
APP_SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key
```

> 🔒 **Alternatively**, if you're not using a `.env` file, you can directly include the OpenAI key in your code (for local testing only):

```python
from openai import OpenAI
client = OpenAI(api_key="your-openai-api-key")
```

7. **Run the application**

```bash
python wsgi.py

## 🤖 OpenAI API Integration (for AI Assistant)

This section enables the AI Assistant chat feature powered by OpenAI's GPT model.

### 🔐 1. Get Your OpenAI API Key

* Visit [https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys)
* Log in and generate a new API key

### 🗂️ 2. Add Key to Code or `.env`

#### Option A: Environment File (Recommended)

```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
```

#### Option B: Hardcoded (for quick testing only)

```python
from openai import OpenAI
client = OpenAI(api_key="your-openai-api-key")
```

### 🧠 3. How It Works

* The `/ai-chat` Flask route sends your question to OpenAI’s GPT (e.g., `gpt-3.5-turbo`)
* Returns a contextual response to power your in-app AI assistant

### 📦 4. Requirements

Make sure `openai` is included in your `requirements.txt`:

```
openai>=1.0.0
```

Install it manually if not:

```bash
pip install openai
```

### 🧪 5. Test It

Ask a question using the assistant on the frontend (bottom-right chat bubble).
You should see an intelligent reply generated from your query.
